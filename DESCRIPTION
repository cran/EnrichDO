Description: To implement disease ontology (DO) enrichment analysis, this package is designed and presents
            a double weighted model based on the latest annotations of the human genome with DO terms, by
            integrating the DO graph topology on a global scale. This package exhibits high accuracy that
            it can identify more specific DO terms, which alleviates the over enriched problem. The package
            includes various statistical models and visualization schemes for discovering the associations
            between genes and diseases from biological big data.
